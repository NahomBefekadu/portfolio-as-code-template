# Getting Started with Portfolio as Code

Welcome to Portfolio as Code! This guide will help you set up your structured professional development system and start capturing your growth journey.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Git and version control
- A GitHub account (or other Git hosting service)
- Text editor of your choice
- Optional: Node.js if you plan to use automation tools

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create Your Repository

**Option A: Use GitHub Template**
1. Visit the [Portfolio as Code Template](https://github.com/example/portfolio-as-code-template)
2. Click "Use this template" â†’ "Create a new repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-portfolio` or `professional-development`)
4. Choose public or private visibility
5. Click "Create repository from template"

**Option B: Clone and Customize**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/portfolio-as-code-template.git my-portfolio
cd my-portfolio
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Customize Configuration

Edit `codex.config.json` to match your preferences:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Your Portfolio Name",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "description": "Your professional development journey"
  },
  "integrations": {
    "github": {
      "repository": "yourusername/my-portfolio",
      "branch": "main"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Add Your First Content

Copy a template and create your first entry:

```bash
# Document your first learning
cp templates/learning-template.md content/learnings/2024/my-first-learning.md

# Edit the file with your content
# Commit when ready
git add content/learnings/2024/my-first-learning.md
git commit -m "Add first learning: [topic]"
git push
```

## Your First Week with Portfolio as Code

### Day 1: Setup and First Learning

1. **Complete the Quick Setup** (above)
2. **Document one recent learning** using the learning template
3. **Commit your first entry** to establish the habit

**Tips:**
- Start with something you learned recently while the context is fresh
- Don't worry about perfect formatting - focus on capturing the knowledge
- Include code examples or links that will be useful later

### Day 2: Record a Recent Achievement

3. **Include challenges you overcame**

**Examples of achievements to capture:**
- Completed project or feature
- Resolved a difficult bug
- Learned a new technology
- Helped a teammate
- Gave a presentation

### Day 3: Start a Blog Draft

1. **Create a blog post** from something you've been thinking about
2. **Use the blog template** to structure your thoughts
3. **Don't worry about publishing** - focus on getting ideas down

**Blog post ideas:**
- Lessons from a recent project
- Comparison of tools or technologies
- Tutorial for something you learned
- Reflection on career growth

### Day 4: Create Your First AI Prompt

1. **Think about a repetitive task** you do with AI tools
2. **Use the prompt template** to document a useful prompt
3. **Include examples** of how you've used it

**Common prompt categories:**
- Code review checklists
- Debugging assistance
- Writing improvement
- Learning explanations

### Day 5: Weekly Review

1. **Use the weekly review template** to reflect on your first week
2. **Document your experience** setting up the system
3. **Plan improvements** for the following week

## Establishing Your Workflow

### Daily Habits (5-10 minutes)

**Morning:**
- Review yesterday's work for learning opportunities
- Check if any achievements from yesterday should be documented

**Evening:**
- Quick brain dump of key learnings or insights
- Note any achievements or progress made
- Update drafts or works in progress

### Weekly Habits (30 minutes)

**Friday afternoon or weekend:**
- Review the week's content and organize
- Complete your weekly review
- Plan learning goals for the next week
- Update any drafts or ongoing projects

### Monthly Habits (1 hour)

**End of month:**
- Review content quality and organization
- Identify patterns in your learning and growth
- Plan content gaps to address
- Update templates if needed
- Back up your repository

## Content Organization Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Files:**
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include dates when relevant
- Examples: `typescript-advanced-patterns.md`, `q3-2024-review.md`

**Tags:**
- Use consistent, lowercase tags
- Start with broad categories, add specific ones
- Examples: `["typescript", "patterns", "generics"]`

### Writing Guidelines

**Frontmatter:**
- Always include required fields for your content type
- Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD)  
- Add tags that will help you find content later
- Include metrics and impact where possible

**Content Structure:**
- Start with context - why did you learn this?
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- End with next steps or applications
- Link to related content when relevant

### Git Workflow

**Commit Strategy:**
```bash
# For new content
git add content/learnings/2024/new-topic.md
git commit -m "learning: add advanced React patterns notes"

# For achievements
git add content/achievements/2024/project-launch.md  
git commit -m "achievement: document successful product launch"

# For updates
git add content/learnings/2024/existing-topic.md
git commit -m "learning: update TypeScript notes with new examples"
```

**Branch Strategy:**
- Use `main` for stable content
- Create feature branches for major content additions
- Use pull requests for review if working with others

## Integration Options

### Basic Integration: Static Files

**Pros:**
- Simple and reliable
- Works with any text editor
- Easy to backup and version
- Platform independent

**Cons:**

### Intermediate: Codex Application

**Setup:**
1. Clone and set up the [Codex app](https://github.com/example/codex-app)
2. Configure database connection
3. Run sync command to import your content
4. Use web interface for editing and searching

**Benefits:**
- Rich markdown editor
- Full-text search
- Tag-based filtering

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I don't know what to write about"

**Solutions:**
- Start with recent work - what did you debug yesterday?
- Document tools you use regularly
- Explain concepts to your past self
- Write about mistakes and lessons learned
- Review old code and extract insights

### "I don't have time for this"

**Solutions:**
- Start with 5 minutes per day
- Use voice memos then transcribe later
- Write during commute or breaks
- Focus on high-impact learnings only
- Use templates to speed up writing

### "My writing isn't good enough"

**Solutions:**
- Remember this is for your own benefit first
- Focus on capturing knowledge, not perfect prose
- Use bullet points and informal language
- Improve gradually over time
- Consider it practice for better writing

### "I forget to update it"

**Solutions:**
- Set calendar reminders
- Link to existing habits (end of workday)
- Start smaller with weekly updates
- Use automation tools where possible
- Find an accountability partner
