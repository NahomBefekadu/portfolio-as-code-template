```
You are an expert technical writer helping create a comprehensive blog post outline. Please create a detailed structure for a technical blog post about:

**Topic:** [YOUR_TOPIC]
**Target Audience:** [AUDIENCE_LEVEL] (e.g., beginner developers, senior engineers, etc.)
**Estimated Length:** [WORD_COUNT] words
**Goal:** [WHAT_SHOULD_READERS_LEARN_OR_DO]

Please provide:

1. **Compelling Title Options** (3-5 variations with different angles)
2. **Hook/Opening** (2-3 different approaches to grab attention)  
3. **Detailed Outline** with:
   - Main sections and subsections
   - Key points to cover in each section
   - Code examples or visuals needed
   - Estimated word count per section
4. **Conclusion Strategy** (how to wrap up and call-to-action)
5. **SEO Considerations** (keywords, meta description, tags)
6. **Engagement Elements** (polls, questions, interactive demos)

**Additional Context:**
- Publication platform: [PLATFORM] (dev.to, personal blog, etc.)
- Available time for writing: [TIME_CONSTRAINT]

Focus on creating content that provides real value and actionable insights for developers.
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: TypeScript Performance Post

**Input:**
```
Topic: TypeScript compilation performance optimization
Target Audience: Intermediate to senior developers with large codebases
Estimated Length: 2500 words
Goal: Help developers reduce TypeScript build times by 50%+
Platform: Dev.to and personal blog
Available time: 8 hours over 2 weeks
Experience: 2 years optimizing TS performance in production
```

**AI Response:**
```markdown
# Blog Post Outline: TypeScript Performance Optimization

## Title Options

1. **"TypeScript Performance Optimization: Cut Your Build Times by 75%"** 
   - Benefit-focused, includes specific metric
   
2. **"Beyond the Basics: Advanced TypeScript Compilation Performance"**
   - Appeals to experienced developers, suggests depth
   
3. **"The Complete Guide to TypeScript Build Speed Optimization"**
   - Comprehensive angle, good for search
   
4. **"From 6 Minutes to 90 Seconds: My TypeScript Performance Journey"**
   - Personal story angle, relatable
   
5. **"TypeScript Performance: What Your Team Needs to Know"**
   - Team-focused, practical

**Recommended:** Option 1 for Dev.to (metric-driven), Option 4 for personal blog (story-driven)

## Hook Options

**Option A - Problem Statement:**
"Our TypeScript build went from 30 seconds to 6 minutes as our codebase grew. Sound familiar? Here's how we brought it back down to 90 seconds without sacrificing type safety."

**Option B - Surprising Fact:**
"The single TypeScript configuration change that reduced our build time by 40% was something 90% of developers never think to optimize..."

**Option C - Story Opening:**
"At 3 AM on a critical deployment night, our CI pipeline was timing out. The culprit? TypeScript compilation that had silently grown from manageable to impossible..."
